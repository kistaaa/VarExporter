# VarExporter
This simple app is mainly for learning/teaching purposes and 100% Svelte! Just edit the variable-value pairs, and it will diferentiate strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and objects, and generate code based on the options provided.

# How to use
Just copy and paste the contents of *VarExporter.svelte* into [Svelte Repl](https://svelte.dev/repl/) to see it running!
Or download and save *VarExporter.svelte* in your svelte project folder and import it in your main app.
